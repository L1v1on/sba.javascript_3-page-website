# AD - SBA - HTML/CSS/JavaScript - Ezra Vance



### Description
* This is my submission to the SBA. The goal was to use all the skills learned during weeks 2 and 3.
The 3 web pages are built and styled using HTML and CSS. The interactions I have on the pages are done through events and defined in JavaScript.
